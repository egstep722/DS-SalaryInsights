In this project I used Regression Modeling to understand what factor influence how a salary is determined. 
I utilized 3 experiments in this project 2 of which expounded on linear regression modeling and the 3rd experiment focusing on Random Forest Regressor models.  
In each experiment, I aimed to improve my models to better interpret my data without using supervised models.
